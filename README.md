#LightUp

##Introduction
Animated LEDs are fantastic for decorating kitchens, personal computer desks, the outside of a house, bottom side of vehicles, cosplays, and many more things. Unfortunately the code that one has to create tends to be long and very confusing to those who arenâ€™t programmers. LightUp aims to make animating LEDs as simple as possible.
